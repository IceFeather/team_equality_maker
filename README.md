The algorithm uses a taboo research to make the team the more equaly possible. 
The player can choose two favorite rules, if the first does not fit in any team, the second is counted.
The algorythme use a first in list, first processed. Thus the player at the end of the list could not be included in the tournament created with this tool as there would not be enough poeple to fill a 5 players team.
